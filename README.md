# Math Garden<br>![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Description

  A math game where the user draws their answer to a math problem on a canvas element.  A Tensorflow model, which has been trained on handwritten number samples, interprets the hand drawn number.  The user is given a conditionally rendered message as to whether the answer is correct.  For each correct answer, the "garden" grows.
